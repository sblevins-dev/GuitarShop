## GuitarShop

### Description
This Next.js application is an e-commerce site for a guitar shop. It allows users to browse through a selection of guitars, view product details, add items to a shopping cart, and simulate a checkout process (without connecting to an external payment service). The site uses static data and does not integrate with a backend or include Stripe for payment processing.

- Product Details: Click on a guitar to view detailed information.
